I am working as a Post-Doc at [GESIS – the Leibniz Institute for the Social Science](https://www.gesis.org/home) in Cologne, Germany at the Computational Social Science department. 

I am interested in applying data science methods, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to research subjects, such as deception detection, fraud prevention, dark web markets, and data biases impacting ML performances.
